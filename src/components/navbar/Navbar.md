# Navigation Bar

Please note that this is the way I'm documenting this code for my personal use so that retaining it will be easier further down the line. You are free to use it/give suggestions as well.

### Progress So Far

- Navbar is Finished Statically
- The lower navbar is to be shown only when scrolling.
- The navbar remains sticky
- The functionality to be added is:
  - Dynamically changing menu checking the user logged in or not
  - React-router-functionality

### Snippets

      <hr />
      <div>
        ...
        ...
        ...
      </div>
    </>

- These are React Fragments. In Case Someone Wants to return more than two elements in a react component without using a div, we can use the react fragments. This does help us in decluttering our HTML app since we do not need to use useless divs again and again.
