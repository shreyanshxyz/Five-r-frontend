# Navigation Bar

Please note that this is the way I'm documenting this code for my personal use so that retaining it will be easier further down the line. You are free to use it/give suggestions as well.

### Progress So Far

- Navbar is Finished Statically
- The functionality to be added is:
  - The lower navbar is to be shown only when scrolling.
  - The navbar remains sticky
  - React-router-functionality
